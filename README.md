# CarpentryConnect2024
UiO is planning a CarpentryConnect event in spring 2024 - if circumstances allow it

## Initial Ideas - Pre-Planning

At the Nordic-Baltic Social Meetup during CarpentryCon@Home on Aug 7, 2020, the CarpentryConnect format was introduced and tentative plans for hosting the event in spring/summer 2021 in Oslo were presented, granted that local and international travel regulations allow an on-site event for the Nordic-Baltic region. It looks like most would favor a CarpentryCon in May 2021. Since a CarpentryConnect is a region-based networking and knowledge exchange event, the focus was decided to be on the Nordic-Baltic / Northern European region, however, interested parties from outside the region are welcome as well.
Briefly, the idea of having an expanded version of ResearchBazaar was discussed and it was pointed out that a ResBaz is perceived to be a more disciplinary inclusive event, not solely focusing on Carpentries and thus allowing for a broader audience and scope. Different countries have different experiences with hosting these, though, and a CarpentryConnect event with a decidedly broader scope will be pursued.
